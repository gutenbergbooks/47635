</div>

<p class="sde">ENTER, <span class="smcap">c.d.</span>, <span class="speaker">Diana</span>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Diana.</span> Well, Alice Berning, what do you mean by
being indoors on such a beautiful day? Come, put on
your wraps, my machine <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Diana, you are a regular steam engine. No,
I cannot accept your kind invitation to go for a spin.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Diana.</span> Do you know what brought me here to-day?
It was to ask you to accompany us on our tour through
the north next week. (<span class="sdi">Sits on arm of <span class="speaker">Alice's</span> chair</span>)
There's a dear. Say you will come. Why, you cannot
imagine how disappointed Jack and I will be, not mentioning
all our other guests, if you refuse.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Really, Diana, I am very sorry to have to refuse.
But I simply cannot go. Why, look at all this
correspondence and no one but myself to answer it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Diana.</span> Why don't you get a stenographer? Why
not advertise?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Oh, I've done that&mdash;I advertised for <em>a</em> stenographer,
and, would you believe it, when I came down
this morning there were at least twenty-five applicants
outside my door clamoring to get in.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Diana.</span> And how did you get rid of them?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> I interviewed each one separately, but found
not one qualified to do my work. I verily believe if I
encounter another applicant like any of my last ones
I shall close up shop and bury myself in the woods.
(<span class="sdi">Woe-begone look</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> (<span class="sdi">fingering cards and papers on desk</span>). Alice
Marie Jenkins Berning, what does this mean? Why
there isn't anything on these so-called letters but meaningless
words. Since when did Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Courld,
Mr. Montemout and all these other society favorites become
your clients? Ah-ah&mdash;the plot thickens&mdash;so Dick
has been consulting you, too? I suppose he wishes to
sue for a separation or something like that. (<span class="sdi">Cries
wildly</span>) Oh dear, oh dear!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Diana, if you do not stop that nonsense you
will spoil my practice. What will my clients think if
they should come in and see you carrying on so?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> (<span class="sdi">sobs</span>). Oh, but my husband; to think he has
deceived me so. Oh dear, oh dear!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> For goodness sake, stop! And how unlucky
you should find out the real state of affairs.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> (<span class="sdi">brightly</span>). Come now, own up. You haven't
had a client since you started, and these papers are
only pretenses so that a promising client might think
you prosperous.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<span class="sdi">sighs</span>). Well, I might as well own up. I certainly
have had bad luck; but, never mind, my luck will
change.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Diana.</span> Ah, dearie, when will you learn your lesson?
You were never meant to battle and worry like this,
<span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> I am <span class="locked"><em>not</em>&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Diana</span> (<span class="sdi">places hand over <span class="speaker">Alice's</span> mouth</span>). Now there,
please do not interrupt me. Of course you are worrying;
why there are tiny wrinkles forming across your
brow, and before you know it your mouth will become a
straight line and the sparkle will disappear from your
dear eyes. Now come&mdash;give up this silly fad.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Can't. When I started this, everyone was
against me, especially father and Tom, and now that
I've started I shall continue. But how I do wish for
better business, and also for an office assistant.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Diana.</span> Well, (<span class="sdi">Walks toward <span class="smcap">c.d.</span></span>) I've got a date
with the dressmaker. I'm sorry you are so firm about
this thing. Well, good-bye and good luck. <span class="sdr">[EXIT <span class="smcap">c.d.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Well, it could not be avoided, (<span class="sdi">Rearranges
papers</span>) but I will <em>not</em> give it up. Why, I'm stationed
here a month and not a client yet. (<span class="sdi">Listens</span>) I do believe
someone is coming toward this office. I must put
on a business air. (<span class="sdi">Through telephone; makes sure it
does not ring</span>) Yes, I know&mdash;but you see business is so
rushed now. (ENTER <span class="smcap">c.d.</span> <span class="speaker">Bell</span>) Well, I might consider
it. Just a minute, please. (<span class="sdi">To <span class="speaker">Bell</span></span>) Just be
seated a minute, please. (<span class="sdi">Through telephone</span>) As I was
saying, I cannot consider it below $5,000.... What's
that?... I'm sorry, but my advice is always worth
that.... No, not a cent less....</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bell.</span> I beg <span class="locked">your&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<span class="sdi">waves <span class="speaker">Bell</span> to silence; continues through telephone</span>).
No, I cannot spare time now.... Yes, come
over to-morrow.... Oh, about this time.... Good
day. (<span class="sdi">Writes</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bell.</span> But I <span class="locked">say&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Just a minute, please, and then I'll attend to
you. (<span class="sdi">Writes, blots, folds</span>) Well, madam, what can I
do for you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bell.</span> Well&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;jus-t&mdash;<span class="locked">just&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Please, my time is valuable.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bell.</span> I just wanted to know if&mdash;if&mdash;you would contribute
to the home for disabled animals?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<span class="sdi">gasps</span>). No, madam, I am not interested&mdash;in&mdash;animals.
Good-day. (<span class="sdi"><span class="normal">EXIT</span> <span class="speaker">Bell</span>, nervously, <span class="smcap">c.d.</span></span>)
Well, of all the nerve! And all that energy wasted.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Johnickstoner.</span> I&mdash;I&mdash;came&mdash;in&mdash;answer to
your advertisement.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Take a seat, please. Now write your name
and address. (<span class="sdi"><span class="speaker">Miss Johnickstoner</span> writes name</span>) Well,
Miss Johnickstoner, what is your average speed in
stenography?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss John.</span> I&mdash;I&mdash;don't&mdash;do&mdash;not&mdash;know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Well, try. (<span class="sdi">Dictates</span>) Dear Sir: We are in
receipt of your favor of the 9th inst. Now with reference
to your claim <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;</span>(<span class="sdi"><span class="speaker">Miss Johnickstoner</span> brings handkerchief
to face; sobs</span>) My dear&mdash;eh&mdash;Miss, what is
the trouble?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss John.</span> I didn't get the word after receipt.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> We'll try again. Ready? (<span class="sdi">Dictates</span>) Dear
Sir: We are in receipt of your favor of the 9th inst.
Now with reference to <span class="locked">your&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;</span>(<span class="speaker">Miss Johnickstoner</span>
<span class="sdi">stops; looks up at <span class="speaker">Alice</span>; sobs</span>) What now?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss John.</span> My point broke.</p>

drop for the present. You <span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;</span>(<span class="sdi">Long wail from

waiting for her. Ugh!</p>

<p class="sde">ENTER <span class="speaker">Miss Chickenfencer</span>, <span class="smcap">c.d.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Chickenfencer.</span> I believe I'm in the right
place. I came in answer to your advertisement.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Yes? Now, before we begin, are you addicted
to crying?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Chicken</span> (<span class="sdi">takes small powder puff from handbag;
powders nose</span>). What a funny question. Well, you see,
if the story is really sad, I shed a few tears. You know,
the kind (<span class="sdi">Dramatically</span>) where they are just about to be
married, when he receives a letter from his father commanding
him to come home&mdash;he goes but she remains;
day by day she longs for him, and gradually fades away&mdash;and&mdash;just
as she&mdash;is dying&mdash;her&mdash;long-lost&mdash;<span class="locked">lost&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> I'm sorry, but <span class="locked">really&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Chicken.</span> Oh, that's all right; I was almost
finished anyway. (<span class="sdi">Looks around office</span>) Say, I kind-a
like this place. What are the wages?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> I start at $20.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Chicken.</span> $20? Well&mdash;I might consider it.
What am I required to do?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> I suppose you can take dictation, also answer
the telephone when I'm not here.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Chicken.</span> You bet I can. You should <span class="locked">have&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> I'll dictate a little to you now.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Chicken.</span> Very well. Fire away.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<span class="sdi">dictates</span>). Dear Sir: We are in receipt of
<span class="locked">your&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Chicken.</span> Isn't it funny? Now at my last place,
the boss said that word just like you, and because I corrected
him he was furious.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> To which word do you refer?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Chicken.</span> Why, you said receipt instead of
recipe.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> I prefer saying receipt. We shall continue
now&mdash;(<span class="sdi">Dictates</span>)&mdash;letter of the 6th inst. The claim you
mentioned in your letter is one that will be hard to
tackle.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Chicken.</span> Good gracious, I'm stuck. Say, how
do you write that word? (<span class="sdi">Thinks</span>) Oh, never mind, I
know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> You know that many of my clients have had
similar cases, but I have had to refuse to take them.
Although I would like to take your case I am afraid&mdash;(<span class="sdi"><span class="speaker">Miss
Chickenfencer</span> throws pencil down</span>)&mdash;that I shall
have <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;</span>(<span class="sdi">To <span class="speaker">Miss Chickenfencer</span></span>) Why are you
not writing?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Chicken.</span> Goodness! you are a regular steam
engine. Say, would you mind if I took off my coat and
hat. I'm sure we'll become real intimate&mdash;(<span class="sdi">Powders
nose</span>)&mdash;and you sitting there all that time and not telling
me that my nose was shiny.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Are you finished? I hate to disturb you,
<span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Chicken.</span> Oh, that's all right. Just a minute
until I fix this dip. Say, isn't it awful when you wash
your hair. I can't do a thing with mine. Now I have
a friend whose hair is <span class="locked">so&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Really you must excuse me, but would you
mind reading the letter as far as you have gone?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Chicken.</span> Certainly not. Here goes. (<span class="sdi">Reads</span>)
We are in recipe&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Receipt.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Chicken.</span>&nbsp;<span class="locked">&mdash;of</span> your favor of the 6th inst. The

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Oh!! Claim.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Chicken.</span> Oh, of course. (<span class="sdi">Giggles</span>) How stupid
of me. (<span class="sdi">Reads</span>)&nbsp;<span class="locked">&mdash;you</span> mentioned in your letter is one
that will be hard to <span class="locked">tickle&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Oh, <span class="locked">lor&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Chicken.</span> You know that many of my <span class="locked">giants&mdash;&mdash;</span>
(<span class="sdi">Telephone rings</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<span class="sdi">through 'phone</span>). Hello&mdash;yes&mdash;who?&mdash;Miss
Chickenfencer?&mdash;Why no, there <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Chicken.</span> Hold on there. That's for me.
(<span class="sdi">Through 'phone</span>) Hello&mdash;Oh, it is you, Bob? Yes, I
met him on Wall Street and told him where I was bound
for. Go on! What are you trying to do? Oh. Bob stop.
You know I did not.... I say I <em>did not</em>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> My dear <span class="locked">Miss&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Chicken</span> (<span class="sdi">waves <span class="speaker">Alice</span> to silence</span>). That will be
great. Oh, that's all right; this woman here is a perfect
dear. I know she won't mind my taking this afternoon
off.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Well of all the nerve.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Chicken.</span> Well, about two o'clock? Very well&mdash;good-bye.
(<span class="sdi">Hangs up receiver</span>) Isn't he the sport?
You should see him. Six feet two; dark eyes and hair;
dances divinely, and, talk about giving you a good time,
he is right there. How fortunate I am to have him ask
me to-day when I was feeling so bored with being indoors&mdash;and,
oh, the dance afterwards. Whew! Oh, I
could hug you to death, you old dear, to let me off like
this to enjoy myself. (<span class="sdi">Dances around stage</span>) Something
great is going to happen to-day. I feel it. Just
think, first I am employed here, and now Bob is going
to take me <span class="locked">out&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> I'm sorry, <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Chicken.</span> There, there, all right. I know you're
going to say you are so sorry that it is not a nicer day.
Oh, but we do not mind the weather in the least. (<span class="sdi">Looks
in mirror</span>) Goodness! this mirror is too small. Tell me,
is my hat on at the right angle? Oh, I guess it is all
right. (<span class="sdi">Walks to door</span>) I'll see you to-morrow at 10
o'clock. That's the time, is it not?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> My dear young lady, you need not come back
<span class="locked">at&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Chicken.</span> You are too kind hearted. And I
never take advantage of kindness. Of course I'll come
back to-morrow. You were just going to say I need not
come back until to-morrow afternoon. The idea, leaving
you to answer all this correspondence. (<span class="sdi">Looks at watch</span>)
Good gracious, I must be off. It's half-past one. Now
don't work too hard. Good-bye! <span class="sdr">[EXIT <span class="smcap">c.d.</span></span></p>

I have the pleasure to address the young lady
advertising for a stenographer.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<span class="sdi">aside</span>). I'm in for it again. I suppose this is
the applicant. (<span class="sdi">To <span class="speaker">Miss Prune</span></span>) Yes, I have the painful

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Prune.</span> I wonder what good fortune directed

(<span class="sdi">Sews</span>) whether to accept this <span class="locked">position&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<span class="sdi">aside</span>). She is mine already.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Prune.</span> <span class="locked">...&mdash;or</span> whether to take that of a secretary
to a young man. But I said to myself, if there is a
woman, noble and upright enough to earn her own living
without depending on mere man, it is my duty as one of
her sex to plod along with her in her courageous career.
So I refused the other position and came I to thee.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> But, my dear madam, I am afraid you did a
foolish thing. Know you not that a secretary's position
pays better than that of an office assistant? The latter
is all I require.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Prune.</span> When you speak like that to me, you
make the tears of sorrow gush forth from my eyes.
(<span class="sdi">Applies handkerchief to eyes; <span class="speaker">Alice</span> smiles</span>) Do you
think money is the only thing worth while? Ah, no!
(<span class="sdi">Stands; very dramatically</span>) I care <em>nothing</em> for money.
It is to <em>help</em> to do <em>something noble</em> that I crave. (<span class="sdi">Hand
over heart</span>) It is here, <em>here</em>, that I feel that there will
come a day when my name, Dewdrop Mehitable Prune,
shall tremble on every lip. I shall be honored and
obeyed. And (<span class="sdi">To <span class="speaker">Alice</span></span>) why will I be distinguished
and honored? Because of my noble nature and willing
ways. I should shrink from taking one penny of yours
to pay me for services rendered you in your hour of
need.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> I am afraid, then, that you have come to the
wrong party. I am not great enough myself, never
mind enabling you to attain your noble heights.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Miss Prune.</span> Say no more about it. Here I am, and
here I intend staying. Pay me what you will; but I
shall continue to maintain this lofty position.</p>

harmless. (<span class="sdi">To <span class="speaker">Miss Prune</span></span>) Would you mind if I

it came to anything higher we were scoffed down. Oh,

<p><span class="speaker">Diana.</span> It is simply this. When I left your office
yesterday I was bound to have you come with us by hook
or by crook, so, very much depressed in spirits, I walked
into the club and who should I meet there but two of
my old school-mates. Instantly I thought of this plan,
and to bring back school-day memories they promised to
help me. My beloved school chums were to apply for the
position you had open and I would also. So, my dear,
Miss Johnickstoner, the first applicant, happens to be
Miss Marie Hopkins, daughter of the mayor of Koscoe,
the second applicant, Miss Chickenfencer, was the most
dare-devil girl in our school, Miss Rose Fishby, and the
third stands before you.</p>

little to do to play such a joke on me.</p>

sure of your coming now.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Indeed. (<span class="sdi">Laughs</span>) Well, I must admit you
certainly played the game high. I suppose I simply
must give in. But, oh dear, how I shall be laughed at.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Diana.</span> All you have got to do is to laugh also. You
know the old saying, "Laugh and the world laughs with
you, weep and you weep alone."</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> But, Mrs. Baxter, what will she say when she
finds this out?</p>

the part Mrs. Baxter played in this tragedy. My, but
her dignity was taken down a bit.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice.</span> I can imagine.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Diana.</span> The only thing I regret is the impression we
gave you of stenographers. I must admit we did exaggerate
a little. But, you see, if we acted as real stenographers,
you would be so pleased and contented with
your lot that you would never consent to give it up.</p>
